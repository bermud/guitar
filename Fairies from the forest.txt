The Fairies from the Forest
G    G  G  G  A  A 
Came to me in my dreams
G    G     G   G  A 
Whispered from a tree

Go the the creek
C          D
Close your eyes


C     A        G
And fly with me 
G   E          D       
And Dance with me

Across the stars 
A     A   A      G  
Where the angels are

G     F    F   E     D   C
Where love and magic are just one
