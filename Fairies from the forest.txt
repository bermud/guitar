The Fairies from the Forest

C               Am
G    G  G  G  A  A 
Came to me in my dreams

C                 D (32,23,15)
G    G     G   G  A 
Whispered from a tree

G          Am
Go the the creek
C          Am 
Close your eyes

C            Am
And fly with me 
C             D      
And Dance with me 


G           Am
Across the stars 
G           Am
Where the angels are

       C      Am      G       C
Where love and magic are just one
