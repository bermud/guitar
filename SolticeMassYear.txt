Em 42                       52
The days are getting longer today

Am 50
Celebrate

      Dm 40          G 52         C 53
Is a new rebirth for you and the Earth

Em 42       52
some years ago
Am 50
in this time of the year
       Dm 40
A wise man,  a saint came
Em 52         C 53
taught us to forgive
Em 42           52
remind us about God
Am 50                 Dm 40 
remind us that we are blessed
     Em 53               C 53        
that all that matters is love

Em
42 53  Am                Dm
