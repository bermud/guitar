Thank you mother earth for the air, the music

the songs flow thorugh the air
and form my heart travels to thw world

Thank you mother earth for the water the ocean, rivers, creeks, 

the ocean -a  sunset near the ocean, close your eyes, 
listen to the waves, let the breeze hug you ..
also a creek listenning to the water flowing jumping from one rock to another
gives you peace and remindsyou that all flows
let ti go baby



Thank you mother earth for the wood, the fire,

connecting our prayers to infinite power

Thank you mother earth, I love you have good day
