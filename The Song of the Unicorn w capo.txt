One afternoon I went to the forest  
40                 53 
and stopped near a rose sunflower meadow
40                     53 
I sat down in silence listenned to the wind
40                       53 
amd smelled the flowers with my heart

AAAAA
40           53 
Then I saw a majestic beautiful creature
40            53 
A horse with colorful skin
       40      53
With a golden, shining main
      40                  53 
And a beam of white light appeared on his forehead
