One afternoon I went to the forest  
40                 53 
and stopped near a rose sunflower meadow
40                     53 
I sat down in silence listenned to the breeze
40                       53 
amd smelled the flowers with my heart

AAAAA

Then I saw a majestic beautiful creature
40                    53 
A horse with colorful skin
       40              53
With a golden, shining main
      40                  53 
And a beam of white light appeared on his forehead
