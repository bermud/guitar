Am(50)                C(53)             G (51)  Am (50)
Opening opening your heart       is the way of Love

Singing singing to your soul     is the way of Love
    
Dancing dancing to the world     is the way of Love

Be greatfull for your life,       is the way of love

For your problems and the teachings,   is the way of love

Let it go, forgive your brother  is the way of Love

Let it go, forgive your sister   is the way of Love

Let it go, forgive yourself      is the way of Love

Share your light and hug each other, is the way of Love

Raise your hands and touch the moon, is the way of love

Let in the fire of the sun,         is the way of love

Sing with the birds in the morning, is the way of Love

Paint in your heart a sunset,    is the way of Love

Take care of pachamamita,        is the way of Love

Peace on earth with all living things, is the way of Love

Hug again until the end,        is the way of Love
