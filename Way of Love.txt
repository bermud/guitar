E-(42)                G(30) 
Opening opening your heart
       D (32) G (30)
Is the way of Love

           
Singing singing to your soul
   
Is the way of Love
  
Dancing dancing to the world
  
Is the way of Love

Let it go, forgive your brother

Is the way of Love

Let it go, forgive your sister

Is the way of Love

Let it go, forgive yourself

Is the way of Love

Share your light and hug each other

Is the way of Love

Sing with the birds in the morning

Is the way of Love

Paint in your heart a sunset

Is the way of Love

Take care of pachamamita

Is the way of Love

Peace on earth with all living things

Is the way of Love

Hug again until the end

Is the way of Love
