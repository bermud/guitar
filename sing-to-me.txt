SING TO ME (Luis Bermudez 20190428)

G (30)                                  D (40)
Sing to me       with the flute of the stars 

         G(30)                       D (40)
Make me dance      universal trance

Dm (23).                    Am (32)
Play guitar       with everyone

Dm (23).                      Am (32)
Kiss the moon    and hug the sun

----

G (30)                                  D (40)
Sing to me         with the flute of the earth 

G (30)                               D (40)
Flowers sing       opening their hearts

Dm (23)                        Am (32)
Find a tree     and stand with him

Dm (23)                    Am (32)
We are all    the rock on the hill

------


G (30)                                  D (40)
Sing to me         with the flute of  the fire 

G (30)                                 D (40)
Make me spark            like a chip of wood 

Dm (23)                        Am (32)
Lead my body       to ecstatic moves

Dm (23)                        Am (32)
We are all         the sun and the power

-------

Lead me heat, my body to ecstatics moves 

I am the sun, I am the trees, I am no more 

Sing to me with the flute of air 
Let me hear across the universe 
The birds in a morning spring 
I am  the wind, the leaves and the ocean waves 

Sing to me with the flute of water
I am the anaconda of the lagoon
Dancing slowly to protect itâ€™s body
I am the rain, the river and the lake
