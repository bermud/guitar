SING TO ME (Luis Bermudez 20190428)


Sing to me with the flute of the stars 
Make me dance like a lost comet
Crossing the universe of celestial bodies 
Hugging the son and kissing my beloved moon

Sing to me with the flute of the earth 
Flowers singing opening their hearts
Trees in Baritone drumming each branch 
I am the rock, the mountain and the soil 


Sing to me with the flute of fire 
Make me explode like a cheap of wood 
Lead me heat, my body to ecstatics moves 
I am the sun, I am the trees, I am no more 

Sing to me with the flute of air 
Let me hear across the universe 
The birds in a morning spring 
I am  the wind, the leaves and the ocean waves 

Sing to me with the flute of water
I am the anaconda of the lagoon
Dancing slowly to protect itâ€™s body
I am the rain, the river and the lake
