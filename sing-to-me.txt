SING TO ME (Luis Bermudez 20190428)

G (30)                                  D (40)
Sing to me       with the flute of the stars 

         G(30)
Make me dance      a universal trance

Dm (23).           Am (32)
Play guitar with everyone

Dm (23).           Am (32)
Kiss the moon and hug the sun



G (30)                                  D (40)
Sing to me         with the flute of the earth 

G (30)                               D (40)
Flowers sing       opening their hearts

Dm (23).           Am (32)
Find a tree and stand with him

Dm (23).           Am (32)
You are the rock on the hill


Trees in Baritone drumming each branch 
I am the rock, the mountain and the soil 


Sing to me with the flute of fire 
Make me explode like a cheap of wood 
Lead me heat, my body to ecstatics moves 
I am the sun, I am the trees, I am no more 

Sing to me with the flute of air 
Let me hear across the universe 
The birds in a morning spring 
I am  the wind, the leaves and the ocean waves 

Sing to me with the flute of water
I am the anaconda of the lagoon
Dancing slowly to protect itâ€™s body
I am the rain, the river and the lake
