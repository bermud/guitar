A-42      C (53)        A- (42)
Birds are singing to my girl

D- (40)         G (30)
In the way to school

A-42      C (53)         A- (42)
Birds are singing to the world
       D-          G
In our way through life 

A-42      C (53)        A- (42)
Birds are singing to my soul
D-           G
Rythm of the morning sun

A-42      C (53)         A- (42)
Birds are singing to my heart
D-               G
When I hear this song

A-42      C (53)        A- (42)
Birds are singing to my dreams
D-             G
Mystical humingbird

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are singing the love song
D-            G
Flying to our hearts
