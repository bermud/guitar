SONG OF BIRDS (May 2019)
capo 3

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are singing to my girl

D- (40)         G (30)
In the way to school

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are in singing to the world

D-                   G
In our way through life 

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are in singing to my soul
D-             G
Rythm of the morning sun

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are in singing to my heart
D-             G
When I hear this song

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are in singing to my dreams
D-             G
Mystical humingbird

A-42      C (53)      A- (42)
Birds are in singing the love song
D-             G
Flying in our hearts
