Birds are singing to my girl

In the way to school

C                        A-
Birds are singing to the world

       D-          G
In our way through life 

C                          A-
Birds are in singing to my soul
        D-     G
In the morning sun

C                          A-
Birds are in singing to my heart
       D-        G
When I sing this song

C                          A-
Birds are in singing to my dreams

Like a huming....bird

C                         A-
Birds are in singing the love song

Flying in our hea     rts
