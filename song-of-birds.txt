SONG OF BIRDS (May 2019)
capo 3

C (53)                   A- (50)
Birds are singing to my girl

D- (40)         G (52)
In the way to school

C                            A-
Birds are in singing to the world

D-                   G
In our way through life 

C                            A-
Birds are in singing to my soul
D-             G
In the morning sun

C                            A-
Birds are in singing to my heart
D-             G
When I sing this song

C                            A-
Birds are in singing to my dreams
D-             G
Like a humingbird

C                            A-
Birds are in singing the love song
D-             G
Flying in our hearts
