TO BE THE BEAT - Isabella Bermudez 20190504

C (21)
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
          G(20)     C(30)
I have it all to myself

D(32).              G(20)                  D (23)
I take you to the beat like heaven in the sky

D (32)               G(20)                  D(23)              G(20)
And I will hold you tight I'll make all promises, promises, promises


And I'll make all promises, promises, promises


Have you ever saw my dance

It's so beatifull, like the beat


So, common come down to the beat

And Dance with me

So, common common dance with me

So, common come down to the beat

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh













but, you take me to the beat like a shelve
