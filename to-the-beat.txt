TO BE THE BEAT - Isabella Bermudez 20190504


Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh

I have it all to myself

you take my from the shelve to the beat

Ill hold on tight

but I make no promises, promises, promises


Have you ever saw my dance

It's so beatifull, like the beat


So, common come down to the beat

And Dance with me

So, common common dance with me

So, common come down to the beat

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh













but, you take me to the beat like a shelve
